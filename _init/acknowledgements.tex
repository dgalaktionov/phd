\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I had to admit to myself that I was stalling before getting to write this page at last. No wonder that some say this is the hardest part! Just to think of the responsibility: so many of you helped and supported me along the way, what if I were to forget mentioning someone? Indeed, any mistakes or typos in these few paragraphs will be the hardest to live with.

It seems appropriate to start with whoever was closest to you during these last years. In some cases, that would be their thesis advisor, but not in my case. Camilia, my beautiful and obstinate wife would have not tolerated such thing! I would have not met her if I had not traveled down the path that culminated in this thesis, which happened in part thanks to her support, for which I am grateful. And of course I would also like thank my parents, who kept in touch month after month, and encouraged me to follow through with whatever path I would choose.

Next, I must thank everyone from my lab who has made this possible, in chronological order. First, Nieves, who made me an offer that I could not refuse and looked after me until the end. Second, Guillermo and Luaces, who in their infinite patience that is so characteristic of a PhD would take the effort to train my younger self. Next came Fari and Andrea, who tutored me and performed a great role in cultivating the required patience in me. Also a huge thanks to everyone who advised and helped me along the way: Fernando, Nelly, Adri\'an, Suil\'en, Tirso and Jeremy, in no particular order.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends Sara, Luis and Chon, who stood by my side all the way more times than I could ask for. This is for you!\\
